This is an archive of the sources of implementations of the X-, Y- and ZMODEM 
protocols, created because i had a hard time finding them after i started to
work on lrzsz again.

# zmtx-zmrx (1994)
a clean, fresh zmodem implementation without any of the stupid features
of the protocol (well, "fresh" it was in 1994).
I took this from one of my backups (yes, virginia, i have backups containing
files i didn't use for 20 years). I have, of course, no idea of where i
downloaded it all those years ago, and i don't know why the timestamps are
from 1996. The should be from 1994. Maybe someone, even me, repackaged it?

# omen technology xyzmodems
Well, the omen website is not reachable anymore, and although the web site
is on archive.org, the same is not true for the omen ftp site.

It's hard to find archives of the omen technology sources on the net, 
although Chuck Forsberg did allow distribution. A number of important 
mirror sites are down (sunsite, inria, ... i miss you, though i remember
calling sunsite often as sinsite).

Those i did find were rarely really clean. Some i downloaded via the web, 
one source file at a time, some were obviously repackaged, and so on.

***note***: do not use this. The code never was secure. Believe me. 
Especially do not, ever, run rz, rb, rx, rc when you do not control the sender.

So, without further ado:

## crzsz-1.13 (2005)
I have no idea why this was called crzsz, and why the version number went down.

I think this is the last public domain version. If that is true, then this
is the version lrzsz was based on.
